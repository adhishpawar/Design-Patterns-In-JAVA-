1. Constructor Should be Private 

2. Object create with help of the Method

3. Creation of Field varible which used to Store the obbject is Private



This implementation Ok with Single Thread implementation

but Using Multiple Threads......  --> if Threads Found Object value equal 
                                    to Null simultaneously then can Access
                                    Singleton Object by two variables. 

Which make System Unsafe. so use Thread Synchronization 



##Breaking Singleton DP

1. Using Replection API to break SingleTon Pattern 
solution 1-> if Object is there ==> throw Exception from inside Constructor
         2-> Use Enum  ==> public Enum Cake 


2. Deserialization:  
soultion --> Implementing ReadResolve Method

3.Cloning the Object
